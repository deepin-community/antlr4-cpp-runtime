Description: ANTLR Parser Generator - C++ runtime support (development files)
 ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator
 for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary
 files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a
 grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
 .
